# OpenAuto
Greetings! Welcome to the OpenAuto GitHub page.
## What is OpenAuto?
OpenAuto is a free, open-source alternative to the proprietary Android automation app "Automate" by developer "LlamaLab"
## But why use it?
* No Google Play Services are used
* There is no telemetry
* There is no proprietary code
## Need devs
I, LittleRyder34, do not know how to code or create UI in Android Studio. I need developers who are willing to do this.
